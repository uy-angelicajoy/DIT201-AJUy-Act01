## What challenges did you face installing Andriod Studio?
- For me it's a smooth installation of the software to my PC, even setting it up and trying how the application works.

## What did you learn about Android app structure?
- I learn that this application is different than other IDE I've used. The stucture of the app is very new to me but I know a time goes by I will get a hang of it, slowly I will adopt it's structure just like the other IDE I've used.
